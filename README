Scripts to make the figures for the HEP CPU benchmarking paper submitted to CSBS in August 2021

The contents of this repository pertains to Figures 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10. There is a separate script to produce each figure. For Figures 3 and 9, there is a python script and a C++ ROOT macro, because I couldn't the stat boxes work in python. For each figure except Figure 7, there is a script to read the data in from a .pkl file and print it. I write this to a text file, which is read by the scripts that make the plots. For Figure 3, there are two scripts to read the data; the output must be combined into a single file.

The format of the data is 
<benchmark name> one of hs06, hepscore, atlas-gen, cms-gen-sim, cms-digi, cms-reco, belle2-gen-sim-reco, lhcb-gen-sim
<CPU model 1>
score1
...
scoreN
<CPU model 2>
score1
...
score N
etc.

There is a block for each benchmark, containing sub-blocks for each CPU, containing the score obtained for that CPU and that benchmark

For Figure 1, the script writes out only the mean and standard deviation of the score for each CPU. The scripts write out the score for each run, so the output contains the full distributions.
